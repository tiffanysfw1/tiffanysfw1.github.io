            <h1 id="one">Student support</h1>
            <p> The transition to university study and living away from home can be a big change for many of our students. If you need a bit of extra support while at the University, whether that’s with your academic work or personal issues, we have an extensive welfare system in place.</p>
            <h1 id="one">Students supporting students</h1>
            <p>Throughout the University and Colleges, there’s an extensive student-run welfare network. Every College students’ union has its own welfare officer or team that can provide support and advice to students. Many Colleges also assign ‘College parents’ (students in other years) to new students to help them settle in.

                Cambridge SU runs campaigns and initiatives about issues that matter to the student community. As every student is a member of SU, Cambridge SU seeks to represent them all effectively.
                
                In addition to this, most clubs, societies and College students’ unions have officers representing various groups within the University. They are able to provide support and advice to ensure all of our students enjoy their time at Cambridge. Many Colleges also assign ‘College families’ to new students to help them settle in.
                
                As every student is a member of the SU, Cambridge SU seeks to represent them all effectively. The Cambridge SU campaigns also provide specific communities for students with shared backgrounds and interests. Many of the campaigns have ‘buddy’ schemes, similar to College families. In addition to this, most clubs, societies and College students’ unions have elected committees to support their members’ welfare as well as provide great opportunities for socialising, having fun and learning new skills.
